Part 3 of the homework
This part of the homework provides a sample code that uses MLP to classify the MNIST dataset. However, it only uses 2 layers of MLP. You will need to modify the code and use 3 layers of MLP. Additionally, you will need to use MLP to classify the Fashion MNIST Dataset.
Hint: you can use 
fashion_mnist = tf.keras.datasets.fashion_mnist
to import Fashion MNIST dataset.
