You will need to:
1.	Complete the merge function in the GDP_Object file.
2.	Complete the functions in the Main file.
3.	After finishing all the functions, run the test file.
To receive full credit, there should be no errors when running the test file.
NOTE: The sample code uses Root-mean-square deviation(RMSD) to measure the accuracy of the model,
the lower the RMSD, the higher the accuracy.
