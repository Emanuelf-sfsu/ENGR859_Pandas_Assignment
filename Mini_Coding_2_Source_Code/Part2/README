You will need to read and understand Chapter 10 of the book. You can find the code for chapter 10 here: 
https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml3/blob/main/10_neural_nets_with_keras.ipynb.
You will need to reorganize the code into the following 4 parts.
1.	Prepare the Dataset
2.	Setting Hyperparameters and defining model
3.	Start Training
4.	Start Testing
You will need to put the code that is already being organized into one Python file, and the file should print out the final testing accuracy.
